| **S.No.** | **Name of the Laboratory** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| 1         | Molecular Biology & Fermentation | The lab offers fermentation of microbes at shake flask and reactor levels for the production of industrially important bioproducts. It is equipped with a 7.5-liter fermenter for primary and secondary metabolite production. Research is focused on biosurfactant production optimization from Lactobacillus probiotics and bacterial cutinases for plastic degradation. |
| 2         | Drug Discovery & Design, Plant Biotechnology | This lab focuses on genomics and genetic engineering of crop plants for improved field traits and resistance to stress. It also involves in silico drug design and development for various diseases. |

**Structural Biology**

**Multidrug Resistance (MDR)** is the antimicrobial resistance of a microbial species to at least one antibiotic from three or more antimicrobial categories. The antimicrobial category is a classification of antimicrobial agents based on their mechanism of action and is specific to the target organism.

The **MDR types** that pose the greatest threat to public health are those bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics. One promising approach to combating MDR is the development of drugs targeting novel microbial mechanisms. Our research focuses on exploring new drug targets from bacterial origins, including *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. We are characterizing **tRNA-modifying enzymes**, such as **dihydrouridine synthases** and **adenosine deaminases** from bacteria, to potentially use these as targets for designing and developing novel antibiotics.

**Plant Tissue Culture Lab**

The **Plant Tissue Culture Lab** allows for the development of a wide variety of plant cells or tissues under sterile and controlled conditions, derived from any part of the plant such as stems, roots, or leaves. These cells or tissues are cultured in special glass vials containing a medium with mineral nutrients, vitamins, and phytohormones to facilitate their growth. The tissue culture technique exploits the totipotency of plant cells (i.e., their genetic ability to regenerate into a complete plant). 

The lab is primarily focused on micropropagation to multiply plants that are hard to propagate through conventional methods. It supports projects on crop improvement, particularly with crops like **cotton, mustard, and tobacco**. Various projects on genetic improvement and propagation of these crops are actively being pursued in this lab.
